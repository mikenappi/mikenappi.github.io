# **Michael Nappi — Design Portfolio**

Welcome to my design portfolio for *CS-130 and CS-257*. 
This site brings together the major projects, prototypes, analyses, and reflections I’ve created throughout the semester. 
Each project demonstrates how I applied human-centered design principles, iteration, critique, and usability testing to arrive at effective design solutions.
