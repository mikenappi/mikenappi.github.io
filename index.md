# **Michael Nappi**

Welcome to my design portfolio for *CS-130 and CS-257*. 
This site brings together the major projects, prototypes, analyses, and reflections I’ve created throughout the semester. 
Each project demonstrates how I applied human-centered design principles, iteration, critique, and usability testing to arrive at effective design solutions.

**Project Type:** Data Visualization  
**Tools:** Tableau  

This project explored how data visualization can support user understanding of performance in basketball, more specifically how shooters perform in different areas of the court. While data-driven, the emphasis was on interpretability, and visual clarity rather than just showing the user raw analytics.

**UX & Design Focus Areas:**
- Providing dense visual data
- Using color and layout intentionally to persuade the user's interpretation of the data
- Supporting quick pattern recognition
- Designing for both casual and knowledgeable users
